  abstract = {A project-based guide to the basics of deep learning.This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach.Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used programming language. Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability and statistics is required, as is a rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python. The book can be used in both undergraduate and graduate courses; practitioners will find it an essential reference.},

  abstract = {Written through a collaboration of expert faculty and medical students from Harvard Medical School, this innovative text delivers a straightforward and clear overview of the major principles, agents, and processes governing human physiology. Emphasis is on understanding the higher-order processes in each organ system. Concepts in Medical Physiology avoids long lists of unprioritized information and undefined jargon by presenting fresh concept diagrams and figures alongside clear explanations of quantitative concepts. It can function equally well as a primary resource or as a review. Eight major sections, comprising a total of 36 chapters, cover general principles, muscle and bone, blood and the immune system, cardiovascular physiology, pulmonary physiology, renal physiology, gastrointestinal physiology, and endocrine physiology. Many useful features simplify mastery of difficult concepts:  Case studies for each major section present detailed cases with signs and symptoms, history, and laboratory data. Questions at the conclusion of each case reinforce important clinical concepts. Reviews of cell biology, basic science, and biochemistry refresh students on the foundations of physiological knowledge. Clinical Application boxes draw the connection between physiology to practical issues students face and help with preparation for the USMLE. Pathophysiology sections are featured in every chapter. Review questions with answers in each chapter aid in preparation for the examination. Integrative Physiology inserts highlight how specific systems, organs, and tissues work together. More than 350 illustrations aid with visual learning, including original schematic diagrams, photos, and tables. Concept-focused summaries conclude each chapter for more effective learning and review. Suggested readings in every chapter provide a valuable resource for further investigation in physiological and clinical ideas.},

  abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence, and the deep-learning subtype in particular, has been enabled by the use of labeled big data, along with markedly enhanced computing power and cloud storage, across all sectors. In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient–doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.},

This survey presents an overview of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) used in deep learning-based medical image analysis. A framework of XAI criteria is introduced to classify deep learning-based medical image analysis methods. Papers on XAI techniques in medical image analysis are then surveyed and categorized according to the framework and according to anatomical location. The paper concludes with an outlook of future opportunities for XAI in medical image analysis.},
