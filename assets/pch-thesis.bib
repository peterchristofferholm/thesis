  abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

  abstract = {Flexible modelling in survival analysis can be useful both for exploratory and predictive purposes. Feed forward neural networks were recently considered for flexible non-linear modelling of censored survival data through the generalization of both discrete and continuous time models. We show that by treating the time interval as an input variable in a standard feed forward network with logistic activation and entropy error function, it is possible to estimate smoothed discrete hazards as conditional probabilities of failure. We considered an easily implementable approach with a fast selection criteria of the best configurations. Examples on data sets from two clinical trials are provided. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) approach can be applied for the estimation of the functional relationships between covariates and time in survival data to improve model predictivity in the presence of complex prognostic relationships. ¬© 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them‚ÄîSTK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53‚Äîcan be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH.},

Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: BCR-ABL is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Since tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the transforming function of BCR-ABL, an inhibitor of the kinase could be an effective treatment for CML. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalating trial of STI571 (formerly known as CGP 57148B), a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. STI571 was administered orally to 83 patients with CML in the chronic phase in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Patients were successively assigned to 1 of 14 doses ranging from 25 to 1000 mg per day. RESULTS: Adverse effects of STI571 were minimal; the most common were nausea, myalgias, edema, and diarrhea. A maximal tolerated dose was not identified. Complete hematologic responses were observed in 53 of 54 patients treated with daily doses of 300 mg or more and typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy. Of the 54 patients treated with doses of 300 mg or more, cytogenetic responses occurred in 29, including 17 (31 percent of the 54 patients who received this dose) with major responses (0 to 35 percent of cells in metaphase positive for the Philadelphia chromosome); 7 of these patients had complete cytogenetic remissions. CONCLUSIONS: STI571 is well tolerated and has significant antileukemic activity in patients with CML in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Our results provide evidence of the essential role of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity in CML and demonstrate the potential for the development of anticancer drugs based on the specific molecular abnormality present in a human cancer.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}There is currently great interest in applying neural networks to prediction tasks in medicine. It is important for predictive models to be able to use survival data, where each patient has a known follow-up time and event/censoring indicator. This avoids information loss when training the model and enables generation of predicted survival curves. In this paper, we describe a discrete-time survival model that is designed to be used with neural networks, which we refer to as Nnet-survival. The model is trained with the maximum likelihood method using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The use of SGD enables rapid convergence and application to large datasets that do not fit in memory. The model is flexible, so that the baseline hazard rate and the effect of the input data on hazard probability can vary with follow-up time. It has been implemented in the Keras deep learning framework, and source code for the model and several examples is available online. We demonstrate the performance of the model on both simulated and real data and compare it to existing models Cox-nnet and Deepsurv.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

VALIDITY AND COVERAGE: Classification of cause(s) of deaths is done in accordance to WHO's rules, since 1994 by ICD-10 codes. A change in coding practices and a low autopsy rate might influence the continuity and validity in cause-specific mortality. CONCLUSION: The longstanding national registration of causes of death is essential for much research. The quality of the register on causes of death relies mainly upon the correctness of the physicians' notification and the coding in the National Board of Health.},

  abstract = {Due to rapid developments in machine learning, and in particular neural networks, a number of new methods for time-to-event predictions have been developed in the last few years. As neural networks are parametric models, it is more straightforward to integrate parametric survival models in the neural network framework than the popular semi-parametric Cox model. In particular, discrete-time survival models, which are fully parametric, are interesting candidates to extend with neural networks. The likelihood for discrete-time survival data may be parameterized by the probability mass function (PMF) or by the discrete hazard rate, and both of these formulations have been used to develop neural network-based methods for time-to-event predictions. In this paper, we review and compare these approaches. More importantly, we show how the discrete-time methods may be adopted as approximations for continuous-time data. To this end, we introduce two discretization schemes, corresponding to equidistant times or equidistant marginal survival probabilities, and two ways of interpolating the discrete-time predictions, corresponding to piecewise constant density functions or piecewise constant hazard rates. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the methods based on the hazard rate parametrization are found to perform slightly better than the methods that use the PMF parametrization. Inspired by these investigations, we also propose a continuous-time method by assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant. The method, named PC-Hazard, is found to be highly competitive with the aforementioned methods in addition to other methods for survival prediction found in the literature.},

However, most of today‚Äôs medical data lack interoperability: hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, the data are difficult to exchange, analyze, and interpret. This slows down medical progress, as technologies that rely on these data ‚Äì artificial intelligence, big data or mobile applications ‚Äì cannot be used to their full potential. In this article, we argue that interoperability is a prerequisite for the digital innovations envisioned for future medicine. We focus on four areas where interoperable data and IT systems are particularly important: (1) artificial intelligence and big data; (2) medical communication; (3) research; and (4) international cooperation. We discuss how interoperability can facilitate digital transformation in these areas to improve the health and well-being of patients worldwide.},

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

However, without access to sufficient data, ML will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making the transition from research to clinical practice.

Emphasis is on understanding the higher-order processes in each organ system. Concepts in Medical Physiology avoids long lists of unprioritized information and undefined jargon by presenting fresh concept diagrams and figures alongside clear explanations of quantitative concepts. It can function equally well as a primary resource or as a review. Eight major sections, comprising a total of 36 chapters, cover general principles, muscle and bone, blood and the immune system, cardiovascular physiology, pulmonary physiology, renal physiology, gastrointestinal physiology, and endocrine physiology. Many useful features simplify mastery of difficult concepts:  Case studies for each major section present detailed cases with signs and symptoms, history, and laboratory data. Questions at the conclusion of each case reinforce important clinical concepts. Reviews of cell biology, basic science, and biochemistry refresh students on the foundations of physiological knowledge. Clinical Application boxes draw the connection between physiology to practical issues students face and help with preparation for the USMLE. Pathophysiology sections are featured in every chapter. Review questions with answers in each chapter aid in preparation for the examination. Integrative Physiology inserts highlight how specific systems, organs, and tissues work together. More than 350 illustrations aid with visual learning, including original schematic diagrams, photos, and tables. Concept-focused summaries conclude each chapter for more effective learning and review. Suggested readings in every chapter provide a valuable resource for further investigation in physiological and clinical ideas.},

  abstract = {This book focuses on statistical methods for the analysis of discrete failure times. Failure time analysis is one of the most important fields in statistical research, with applications affecting a wide range of disciplines, in particular, demography, econometrics, epidemiology and clinical research. Although there are a large variety of statistical methods for failure time analysis, many techniques are designed for failure times that are measured on a continuous scale. In empirical studies, however, failure times are often discrete, either because they have been measured in intervals (e.g., quarterly or yearly) or because they have been rounded or grouped. The book covers well-established methods like life-table analysis and discrete hazard regression models, but also introduces state-of-the art techniques for model evaluation, nonparametric estimation and variable selection. Throughout, the methods are illustrated by real life applications, and relationships to survival analysis in continuous time are explained. Each section includes a set of exercises on the respective topics. Various functions and tools for the analysis of discrete survival data are collected in the R package discSurv that accompanies the book.},
