  abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Feed forward neural networks were recently considered for flexible non-linear modelling of censored survival data through the generalization of both discrete and continuous time models. We show that by treating the time interval as an input variable in a standard feed forward network with logistic activation and entropy error function, it is possible to estimate smoothed discrete hazards as conditional probabilities of failure. We considered an easily implementable approach with a fast selection criteria of the best configurations. Examples on data sets from two clinical trials are provided. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) approach can be applied for the estimation of the functional relationships between covariates and time in survival data to improve model predictivity in the presence of complex prognostic relationships. ¬© 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them‚ÄîSTK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53‚Äîcan be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH.},

Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting.},

Clinical parameters were medical history, current smoking, systolic blood pressure and laboratory biomarkers. In a separate part of the dataset, the concordance statistic of model A was 0.68 (95\% CI 0.64 to 0.71), compared to 0.64 (0.61 to 0.68) for model B and 0.68 (0.65 to 0.72) for model C. Goodness-of-fit and calibration of model A were adequate, also in separate subgroups of patients having coronary, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery or aneurysmal disease. Model A predicted {$<$}20\% risk in 59\% of patients, 20‚Äì30\% risk in 19\% and {$>$}30\% risk in 23\%.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: BCR-ABL is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Since tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the transforming function of BCR-ABL, an inhibitor of the kinase could be an effective treatment for CML. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalating trial of STI571 (formerly known as CGP 57148B), a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. STI571 was administered orally to 83 patients with CML in the chronic phase in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Patients were successively assigned to 1 of 14 doses ranging from 25 to 1000 mg per day. RESULTS: Adverse effects of STI571 were minimal; the most common were nausea, myalgias, edema, and diarrhea. A maximal tolerated dose was not identified. Complete hematologic responses were observed in 53 of 54 patients treated with daily doses of 300 mg or more and typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy. Of the 54 patients treated with doses of 300 mg or more, cytogenetic responses occurred in 29, including 17 (31 percent of the 54 patients who received this dose) with major responses (0 to 35 percent of cells in metaphase positive for the Philadelphia chromosome); 7 of these patients had complete cytogenetic remissions. CONCLUSIONS: STI571 is well tolerated and has significant antileukemic activity in patients with CML in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Our results provide evidence of the essential role of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity in CML and demonstrate the potential for the development of anticancer drugs based on the specific molecular abnormality present in a human cancer.},

The risks of cardiovascular events are frequently underestimated and continue to exist, despite current standards of care for secondary prevention, including lifestyle changes, optimal medical therapy, myocardial revascularization and the use of antiplatelet agents to limit thrombosis. In dispelling the myth of ‚Äòstable‚Äô CAD, we explore the pathophysiology of the disease and the relative contribution of plaque and systemic factors to cardiovascular events.

The lipid hypothesis, proposed by Virchow3 in 1856, suggested that lipid in the arterial wall represented a transduction of blood lipid, which subsequently formed complexes with acid mucopolysaccharides; lipid accumulated in arterial walls because mechanisms of lipid deposition predominated over those of removal.

It is important for predictive models to be able to use survival data, where each patient has a known follow-up time and event/censoring indicator. This avoids information loss when training the model and enables generation of predicted survival curves. In this paper, we describe a discrete-time survival model that is designed to be used with neural networks, which we refer to as Nnet-survival. The model is trained with the maximum likelihood method using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The use of SGD enables rapid convergence and application to large datasets that do not fit in memory. The model is flexible, so that the baseline hazard rate and the effect of the input data on hazard probability can vary with follow-up time. It has been implemented in the Keras deep learning framework, and source code for the model and several examples is available online. We demonstrate the performance of the model on both simulated and real data and compare it to existing models Cox-nnet and Deepsurv.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

  abstract = {Background There are no methods for classifying patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) based on the entire spectrum of pre-existing diseases. Such methods might be clinically useful due to the marked differences in presentation and course of disease. Methods A population-based cohort study from a Danish secondary care setting of patients with IHD (2004-2016) and subjected to a coronary angiography (CAG) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Data sources were The Danish National Patient Registry, in-hospital laboratory data, and genetic data from Copenhagen Hospital Biobank. Comorbidities included diagnoses assigned prior to presentation of IHD. Patients were clustered by means of the Markov Clustering Algorithm using the entire spectrum of registered multimorbidity. The two prespecified outcomes were: New ischemic events (including death from IHD causes) and death from non-IHD causes. Patients were followed from date of CAG/CCTA until one of the two outcomes occurred or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Biological and clinical appropriateness of clusters was assessed by comparing risks (estimated from Cox proportional hazard models) in clusters and by phenotypic and genetic enrichment analyses, respectively. Findings In a cohort of 72,249 patients with IHD (mean age 63.9 years, 63.1\% males), 31 distinct clusters (C1-31, 67,136 patients) were identified. Comparing each cluster to the 30 others, seven clusters (9,590 patients) had statistically significantly higher or lower risk of new ischemic events (five and two clusters, respectively). 18 clusters (35,982 patients) had a higher or lower risk of death from non-IHD causes (12 and six clusters, respectively). All clusters at increased risk of new ischemic events, associated with risk of death from non-IHD causes as well. Cardiovascular or inflammatory diseases were commonly enriched in clusters (13), and distributions for 24 laboratory test results differed significantly across clusters. Clusters enriched for cerebrovascular diseases were generally not at increased risk of the two outcomes. Polygenic risk scores were increased in a total of 15 clusters (48.4\%). Conclusions Clustering of patients with IHD based on pre-existing comorbidities identified subgroups of patients with significantly different clinical outcomes and presented a tool to rank pre-existing comorbidities based on their association with clinical outcomes. This novel method may support better classification of patients and thereby differentiation of treatment intensity depending on expected outcomes in subgroups.},

VALIDITY AND COVERAGE: Classification of cause(s) of deaths is done in accordance to WHO's rules, since 1994 by ICD-10 codes. A change in coding practices and a low autopsy rate might influence the continuity and validity in cause-specific mortality. CONCLUSION: The longstanding national registration of causes of death is essential for much research.

Using machine-learning techniques and including a broader panel of features from electronic health records (EHRs) may improve prognostication. Objectives Developing and externally validating a neural network-based time-to-event model (PMHnet) for prediction of all-cause mortality in IHD. Methods We included 39,746 patients (training: 34,746, test: 5,000) with IHD from the Eastern Danish Heart Registry, who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) between 2006-2016. Clinical and genetic features were extracted from national registries, EHRs, and biobanks. The feature-selection process identified 584 features, including prior diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory test results, and clinical measurements. Model performance was evaluated using time-dependent AUC (tdAUC) and the Brier score. PMHnet was benchmarked against GRACE Risk Score 2.0 (GRACE2.0), and externally validated using data from Iceland (n=8,287). Feature importance and model explainability were assessed using SHAP analysis. Findings On the test set, the tdAUC was 0.88 (95\% CI 0.86-0.90, case count, cc=196) at six months, 0.88(0.86-0.90, cc=261) at one year, 0.84(0.82-0.86, cc=395) at three years, and 0.82(0.80-0.84, cc=763) at five years. On the same data, GRACE2.0 had a lower performance: 0.77 (0.73-0.80) at six months, 0.77(0.74-0.80) at one year, and 0.73(0.70-0.75) at three years. PMHnet showed similar performance in the Icelandic data. Conclusion PMHnet significantly improved survival prediction in patients with IHD compared to GRACE2.0. Our findings support the use of deep phenotypic data as precision medicine tools in modern healthcare systems.},

Such treatment may result in disease stabilization or regression. New terminology describes clinical presentations of Ischemic heart disease categorized as either acute coronary syndrome or chronic coronary syndrome. The reduction in prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease in a symptomatic population causes a lower pretest probability and clinical likelihood of disease, influencing the diagnostic work-up. Noninvasive functional or anatomic imaging for myocardial ischemia is recommended as the initial test to diagnose coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, where obstructive disease cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone. Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography has advanced and is first line in suitable patients, due to high rule-out power and further qualification of the diagnosis by functional assessment using noninvasive nuclear or magnetic resonance technology or CT-based fractional flow reserve (FFR-CT). Optimal medical treatment remains paramount, while FFR-guided myocardial revascularization in patients that are not responsive to antianginal treatment provides further symptom relieve as well as prognostic impact on prevention of spontaneous myocardial infarction.},

  abstract = {Due to rapid developments in machine learning, and in particular neural networks, a number of new methods for time-to-event predictions have been developed in the last few years. As neural networks are parametric models, it is more straightforward to integrate parametric survival models in the neural network framework than the popular semi-parametric Cox model. In particular, discrete-time survival models, which are fully parametric, are interesting candidates to extend with neural networks. The likelihood for discrete-time survival data may be parameterized by the probability mass function (PMF) or by the discrete hazard rate, and both of these formulations have been used to develop neural network-based methods for time-to-event predictions. In this paper, we review and compare these approaches. More importantly, we show how the discrete-time methods may be adopted as approximations for continuous-time data. To this end, we introduce two discretization schemes, corresponding to equidistant times or equidistant marginal survival probabilities, and two ways of interpolating the discrete-time predictions, corresponding to piecewise constant density functions or piecewise constant hazard rates. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the methods based on the hazard rate parametrization are found to perform slightly better than the methods that use the PMF parametrization. Inspired by these investigations, we also propose a continuous-time method by assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant. The method, named PC-Hazard, is found to be highly competitive with the aforementioned methods in addition to other methods for survival prediction found in the literature.},

  abstract = {Digital data are anticipated to transform medicine. However, most of today‚Äôs medical data lack interoperability: hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, the data are difficult to exchange, analyze, and interpret. This slows down medical progress, as technologies that rely on these data ‚Äì artificial intelligence, big data or mobile applications ‚Äì cannot be used to their full potential. In this article, we argue that interoperability is a prerequisite for the digital innovations envisioned for future medicine. We focus on four areas where interoperable data and IT systems are particularly important: (1) artificial intelligence and big data; (2) medical communication; (3) research; and (4) international cooperation. We discuss how interoperability can facilitate digital transformation in these areas to improve the health and well-being of patients worldwide.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, our understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD) has undergone a remarkable evolution. We review here how these advances have altered our concepts of and clinical approaches to both the chronic and acute phases of CAD. Previously considered a cholesterol storage disease, we currently view atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disorder. The appreciation of arterial remodeling (compensatory enlargement) has expanded attention beyond stenoses evident by angiography to encompass the biology of nonstenotic plaques. Revascularization effectively relieves ischemia, but we now recognize the need to attend to nonobstructive lesions as well. Aggressive management of modifiable risk factors reduces cardiovascular events and should accompany appropriate revascularization. We now recognize that disruption of plaques that may not produce critical stenoses causes many acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The disrupted plaque represents a ‚Äúsolid-state‚Äù stimulus to thrombosis. Alterations in circulating prothrombotic or antifibrinolytic mediators in the ‚Äúfluid phase‚Äù of the blood can also predispose toward ACS. Recent results have established the multiplicity of ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù plaques and the widespread nature of inflammation in patients prone to develop ACS. These findings challenge our traditional view of coronary atherosclerosis as a segmental or localized disease. Thus, treatment of ACS should involve 2 overlapping phases: first, addressing the culprit lesion, and second, aiming at rapid ‚Äústabilization‚Äù of other plaques that may produce recurrent events. The concept of ‚Äúinterventional cardiology‚Äù must expand beyond mechanical revascularization to embrace preventive interventions that forestall future events.},

GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales.

We developed and validated prognostic models for all-cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary death in SCAD.Models were developed in a linked electronic health records cohort of 102 023 SCAD patients from the CALIBER programme, with mean follow-up of 4.4 (SD 2.8) years during which 20 817 deaths and 8856 coronary outcomes were observed. The Kaplan‚ÄìMeier 5-year risk was 20.6\% (95\% CI, 20.3, 20.9) for mortality and 9.7\% (95\% CI, 9.4, 9.9) for non-fatal MI or coronary death. The predictors in the models were age, sex, CAD diagnosis, deprivation, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, lipids, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, cancer, depression, anxiety, heart rate, creatinine, white cell count, and haemoglobin. The models had good calibration and discrimination in internal (external) validation with C-index 0.811 (0.735) for all-cause mortality and 0.778 (0.718) for non-fatal MI or coronary death. Using these models to identify patients at high risk (defined by guidelines as 3\% annual mortality) and support a management decision associated with hazard ratio 0.8 could save an additional 13‚Äì16 life years or 15‚Äì18 coronary event-free years per 1000 patients screened, compared with models with just age, sex, and deprivation.These validated prognostic models could be used in clinical practice to support risk stratification as recommended in clinical guidelines.},

Emphasis is on understanding the higher-order processes in each organ system. Concepts in Medical Physiology avoids long lists of unprioritized information and undefined jargon by presenting fresh concept diagrams and figures alongside clear explanations of quantitative concepts. It can function equally well as a primary resource or as a review. Eight major sections, comprising a total of 36 chapters, cover general principles, muscle and bone, blood and the immune system, cardiovascular physiology, pulmonary physiology, renal physiology, gastrointestinal physiology, and endocrine physiology. Many useful features simplify mastery of difficult concepts:  Case studies for each major section present detailed cases with signs and symptoms, history, and laboratory data. Questions at the conclusion of each case reinforce important clinical concepts. Reviews of cell biology, basic science, and biochemistry refresh students on the foundations of physiological knowledge. Clinical Application boxes draw the connection between physiology to practical issues students face and help with preparation for the USMLE. Pathophysiology sections are featured in every chapter. Review questions with answers in each chapter aid in preparation for the examination. Integrative Physiology inserts highlight how specific systems, organs, and tissues work together. More than 350 illustrations aid with visual learning, including original schematic diagrams, photos, and tables. Concept-focused summaries conclude each chapter for more effective learning and review. Suggested readings in every chapter provide a valuable resource for further investigation in physiological and clinical ideas.},

To achieve this goal requires predictions of patient risk that are continuously updated and accurate, and delivered at an individual level with sufficient context and enough time to act. Here we develop a deep learning approach for the continuous risk prediction of future deterioration in patients, building on recent work that models adverse events from electronic health records2‚Äì17 and using acute kidney injury‚Äîa common and potentially life-threatening condition18‚Äîas an exemplar. Our model was developed on a large, longitudinal dataset of electronic health records that cover diverse clinical environments, comprising 703,782~adult patients across 172~inpatient and 1,062~outpatient sites. Our model predicts 55.8\% of all inpatient episodes of acute kidney injury, and 90.2\% of all acute kidney injuries that required subsequent administration of dialysis, with a lead time of up to 48~h and a ratio of 2~false alerts for every true alert. In addition to predicting future acute kidney injury, our model provides confidence assessments and a list of the clinical features that are most salient to each prediction, alongside predicted future trajectories for clinically relevant blood tests9. Although the recognition and prompt treatment of acute kidney injury is known to be challenging, our approach may offer opportunities for identifying patients at risk within a time window that enables early treatment.},

We have applied the workflow to four endpoints (acute kidney injury, mortality, length of stay and 30-day hospital readmission). The workflow can enable continuous (e.g., triggered every 6 h) and static (e.g., triggered at 24 h after admission) predictions.

Failure time analysis is one of the most important fields in statistical research, with applications affecting a wide range of disciplines, in particular, demography, econometrics, epidemiology and clinical research. Although there are a large variety of statistical methods for failure time analysis, many techniques are designed for failure times that are measured on a continuous scale. In empirical studies, however, failure times are often discrete, either because they have been measured in intervals (e.g., quarterly or yearly) or because they have been rounded or grouped. The book covers well-established methods like life-table analysis and discrete hazard regression models, but also introduces state-of-the art techniques for model evaluation, nonparametric estimation and variable selection. Throughout, the methods are illustrated by real life applications, and relationships to survival analysis in continuous time are explained. Each section includes a set of exercises on the respective topics. Various functions and tools for the analysis of discrete survival data are collected in the R package discSurv that accompanies the book.},

  abstract = {The influx of deep learning (DL) techniques into the field of survival analysis in recent years has led to substantial methodological progress; for instance, learning from unstructured or high-dimensional data such as images, text or omics data. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive systematic review of DL-based methods for time-to-event analysis, characterizing them according to both survival- and DL-related attributes. In summary, the reviewed methods often address only a small subset of tasks relevant to time-to-event data - e.g., single-risk right-censored data - and neglect to incorporate more complex settings. Our findings are summarized in an editable, open-source, interactive table: https://survival-org.github.io/DL4Survival. As this research area is advancing rapidly, we encourage community contribution in order to keep this database up to date.},

  abstract = {There has been increasing interest in modelling survival data using deep learning methods in medical research. Current approaches have focused on designing special cost functions to handle censored survival data. We propose a very different method with two simple steps. In the first step, we transform each subject's survival time into a series of jackknife pseudo conditional survival probabilities and then use these pseudo probabilities as a quantitative response variable in the deep neural network model. By using the pseudo values, we reduce a complex survival analysis to a standard regression problem, which greatly simplifies the neural network construction. Our two-step approach is simple, yet very flexible in making risk predictions for survival data, which is very appealing from the practice point of view.
