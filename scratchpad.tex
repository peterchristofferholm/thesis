AI-driven medical prediction models are able to synthesize large amounts
of electronic health data into risk scores or estimates that can be used
to assess the risk and condition of the individual patient.

Complications also occur in otherwise asymptomatic patients, 
and for that reason risk evaluation should apply to both patients
with out without symptoms.

Although revascularization can relieve symptoms for the culprit lesions
responsible for myocardial ischemia, it may not prevent the progression
of other neighboring lesions and future acute thrombotic events.

\section{Computational models in cardiology}

Using single-lead lectrocardiogram recordings from \num{53877} patients,
Hannun et al.\autocite{hannunCardiologistlevel2019}
constructed a deep neural network
to identify 12 difference classes of cardiac rythm.
In the validation of their algorithm on an independent test set,
the authors were able to show that the computer model
significantly outperforms the average cardiologist.

\section{Miscellaneous}

Systematic deugging and continuous monitoring and validation 
is of utmost importance if we are to release AI algorithms into the wild%
\autocite{topolHighperformance2019}.

In computer vision tasks in the medical domain,
deep-learning models have achieved physician-level performance
in many different diagnostic tasks
ranging from


Deep learning is at its core a form of representation learning.
~\autocite{estevaGuide2019}
Each layer in a neural network is a different representation,
and by stacking several of such layers on top of each others,
the representation in one hidden layer
feeds into the next layer and
is thereby being transformed into an even more abstract representation%
~\autocite{estevaGuide2019}.
This allow neural network models to identify patterns in sparse, noisy,
and highly heterogeneous data without the need for expert feature engineering,
which makes them particularly pertinent to healthcare applications.%

\subsection{Scope of Explanations}

The scope of an explanation is the difference between
explanations for a complete model and
explanations for a single output.
Global explanation covers feature importance estimates 
for the entire dataset.
Local explanations, on the other hand, seeks to explain
the impact of the specific example under scrutiny.

A SHAP-waterfall plot is an example of a local explanation.
A saliency map of a chest radiograph that shows
which pixels contributed to the label \enquote{liver cancer}
is another example.

Shapley values measures the marginal contribution
of each individual feature.


\section{Evaluating prediction models}

Visualization of model performance.
A calibration shows the link between 
expected outcome proportion 
and predicted probabilities.

\subsection{Calibration}

A model is said to be well-calibrated
if the probabilistic predictions are reliable.

With a reliable model, 
in a group of individuals predicted to develop diabetes
with a \SI{10}{\percent} risk, 
we would expect to exactly \SI{10}{\percent} to actually develop diabetes.


\subsection{Discrimination}

Discrimination refers to a models ability to rank individuals according 
to their actual risk of experiencing a given event.
The main measure for discrimination is the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC).
For survival models, Harrel's C-index is typically used,
although it is actually an improper scoring metric.
Instead, the time-dependent AUC should be used instead.



\textcite{mohammadDevelopment2022} developed a neural network model
for prediction of 1-year all-cause mortality and admission with heart failure 
after an incident myorcardial infarction.
The model was trained using data from the Swedish \acsfont{SWEDEHEART}
registry and externally validated using the Western Denmark
Heart Registry.
~\autocite{mohammadDevelopment2022}
The model showed great discrimination in both internal and external
validation cohorts.




\textcite{popescuArrhythmic2022}
used deep learning methods for predicting
survival in patients at high risk of cardiac death
from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

Cardiovascular diseases are among the most common conditions in 
patients with multimorbidity.
~\autocite{dunlayMultimorbidity2016}



Another tudy found that a comprehensive machine learning model, incorporating
clinical and CT data, was superior in predicting 10-year cardiovascular and
coronary heart disease deaths compared to traditional assessments. This model
showed higher accuracy, with area under the curve values of 0.845 for
cardiovascular death and 0.860 for coronary heart disease death. It
outperformed both the coronary artery calcium score and the atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease risk score.
~\autocite{nakanishiMachine2021}

In an international collaboration involving \num{11011} patients, 
\citeauthor{thanMachine2019} developed a machine learning model 
designed for objective assessment of myocardial infarction likelihood 
in patients suspected of having this condition. 
Their model demonstrated superior discrimination and calibration 
compared to existing rule-out algorithms.
~\autocite{thanMachine2019}

In survival analysis of competing risks, 
different risks can be modelled marginally,
independently of one another.
This relies on the latent failure assumption.

However, in real-life, the different competing risks 
or \enquote{failure modes} can influence one another
by some shared mechanisms.
Therefore, marginal independent time-to-event models
can therefore be to simplistic.
Instead, it is in such cases
more reasonable to model the competing risks jointly,
such that the dependence structure shared between them
can be leveraged.
