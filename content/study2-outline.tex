\chapter{Study II: Time-to-Event Prediction of All-Cause Mortality}
\label{chap:study2-outline}


In this large prospective cohort study,
we developed a neural network-based survival model
for prediction of all-cause mortality in patients with \ac{IHD}.
The model was built using real-world data from more than \num{40000} patients
with more than \num{400} different features.


First, our machine learning model significantly improved the predicitive
performance compared to the established \ac{GRACE} 2.0 risk-prediction model.
Second, we showed that utilising and integrated a broad array of features
gives significant better performance than limiting the feature set to only
a single modality or a select handfull of established risk factors.
