\chapter{Conclusions and Future Perspectives}
\label{conclusions}



Leveraging population-level genomic datasets from large biobanks,
it should be possible to implement genetics informed risk stratification
for routine clinical use.


\section{Topics to be discussed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider doing ablation studies to produce less-complex versions
        of the predictions models.
    \item Lack of prospective validation of medical prediction models
    \item Lack of clinical deployment and adoption 
    \item Limitations of explainable AI
\end{itemize}
