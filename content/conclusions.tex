\chapter{Conclusions and Future Perspectives}
\label{conclusions}



Leveraging population-level genomic datasets from large biobanks,
it should be possible to implement genetics informed risk stratification
for routine clinical use.


\section{Topics to be discussed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider doing ablation studies to produce less-complex versions
        of the predictions models.
    \item Lack of prospective validation of medical prediction models
    \item Lack of clinical deployment and adoption 
    \item Limitations of explainable AI
\end{itemize}


How important is XAI? 
There have been alot of discussion about, and there are many opinions on, 
the black-box nature of neural networks and 
how it should or should not affect the clinical use of such models.

    Which would you trust: 
    an experimental aircraft that has never flown before
    but has a detailed explanation of why it is safe, 
    or an aircraft that safely completed 100 previous flights 
    and has been carefully maintained,
    but comes with no guaranted explanation?
