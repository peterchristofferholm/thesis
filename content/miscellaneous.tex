A specific chromosomal translocation in 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
results in a constitutively active tyrosine-kinase (BCR-ABL)
that can be targeted with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib~%
\autocite{drukerEfficacy2001}.

For predictive models to be effective,
they must enable clinicians to guide treatment by:
%
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item providing actionable insights on modifiable risk factors
    \item being adapted to the individual patient
    \item being generally applicable in different populations
\end{enumerate*}

AI-driven medical prediction models are able to synthesize large amounts
of electronic health data into risk scores or estimates that can be used
to assess the risk and condition of the individual patient~\autocite{handelmanEDoctor2018}.
